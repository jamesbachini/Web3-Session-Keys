## Web3 Session Keys Quick Start

Welcome to the tutorial on integrating Web3 session keys into your decentralized application (dApp). This guide will take you through the process of enhancing user autonomy and simplifying user interaction with your dApp by leveraging session keys for authentication.

```
npm install
node ./backend.js
```

## Overview

Web3 session keys are a novel approach in decentralized technology, offering dApp users temporary, programmable credentials to interact with backend services. This negates the need for repetitive wallet authentications and allows for transactions to be performed seamlessly. These keys function as limited-permission stand-ins for a user's primary account, bringing the fluidity of traditional web interactions to the blockchain space.

Session keys are part of the shift towards account abstraction, aimed at improving the Ethereum user experience by permitting automatic transaction approval under specified conditions. They can be particularly effective for private off-chain data storage accessible via Web3 wallet authentication, until on-chain privacy solutions like zero-knowledge proofs become more prevalent.

- **Web3 Session Frontend**  
  Explore the frontend implementation using `ethers.js` for initializing a signer, creating a nonce, and signing a custom message. Find the frontend code at [frontend.html](https://github.com/jamesbachini/Web3-Session-Keys/blob/main/frontend.html).

- **Web3 Session Backend**  
  Learn about setting up the backend with Node.js, Express, and ethers to authenticate signatures and verify session keys. Access the full source code at [backend.js](https://github.com/jamesbachini/Web3-Session-Keys/blob/main/backend.js).


## Running The Demo

To run the demo locally:

1. Fork the repository: [Web3 Session Keys](https://github.com/jamesbachini/Web3-Session-Keys).
2. Open a terminal in the cloned directory.
3. Install dependencies with `npm install`.
4. Launch the backend with `node ./backend.js`.
5. Open `http://localhost:3000` in your web browser.

You should now be able to interact with the dApp, authenticate with your wallet, and test the session key functionality.
